##OSCON

Note: PROS was kind enough to send me to the OSCON convention in Portland this past July. 

The conference is held at the Oregon Convention Center show here, also known as the gates of Morodor.


##What is OSCON
![](images/OSCON/OsconFrontDoor.jpg) 
Note: OSCON stands for the Open Source Convention, it started in 1999, and is organized by O'Reilly.


####What is OSCON
##5 Days
Note: This year the conference ran from Sunday to Thursday due to a scheduling conflict, but normally it runs from Monday to Friday. 

There are different ticket options for the number of days that you want to attend.


####What is OSCON
##40 Tutorials
Note: The first two day of the conference are dedicated to tutorials, 
where you have a three and a half hour session in the morning, 
then lunch and a second session in the afternoon. 

For the tutorials you need your own laptop and they send you a list of prerequisites to have installed before you arrive.

The hardest part of the Tutorials is picking which 4 you are going to attend. 


####What is OSCON
##250+ Technical Sessions
Note: The last three days are more of a standard conference layout where you numerous short lectures on a wide array of topics. 

You don't need a laptop for these sessions, although most people were carrying one anyway. 


####What is OSCON
##3000+ Attendees
Note: In other words its a large conference with a LOT of people there.


##Why OSCON
Note: So why would anyone want to cross the country to go to this conference.


####Why OSCON
##New Tools
Note: With anything that is Open Source being a valid topic for a session this is a great conference to be exposed to a wide variety new tools.

Some of the tools I saw covered were: ElasticSearch instead of Solr, Neo4j for graph databases and RabbitMq


####Why OSCON
##New Ideas
Note: While getting exposure to new tools is great, even better is learning how other companies use tools or techniques in novel ways.

For example, NetFlix doesn't provide rest services, functional design pitfalls (erlang), new presentation techniques, etc...


####Why OSCON
##New Ideas for Tools
![](images/OSCON/ElectronicPrinter-cropped.jpg) 
Note: I will admit that this tool doesn't help PROS much, but it is so cool I had to mention it.

This is a 3D printer, and like many of its competitors it can extrude plastic to build up plastic models. 

But more interesting is the fact that you can switch heads in that orange section in the middle, and it can then prototype circuit boards instead. 

The big spools on the front and the small sppols on the left side contain chips on the ribbon that the tool can pick up to then place on the board and sodder in place.


####Why OSCON
##The People
Note: I found that the most important part of the OSCON experience was just the people that were there.  

Tim Berglund - has multiple books and training videos to his credit.  He literally wrote the book on gradle.

Jonathan Ellis - The Apache Cassandra chair in charge of all new development

Neal Ford - Software Architect at ThoughtWorks the founders of the technology radar.  one of the formost proponents of continuous delivery and functional programming.

Shawn Pearce - the founder of the JGit project, which completely reimplemented Git using java.


####Why OSCON
##The People
![](images/OSCON/ward-resized.jpg) 
Note: For those of you that can't read the tiny print on his nametag, this is Ward Cunningham. 

Ward invented the Wiki, the concept of Technical Debt, and created Fit which can be argued was the first BDD testing framework. 


####Why OSCON
####The People
##Tribe Tables
Note: The OSCON ticket price includes lunch. Tribe tables are simple way to make the lunch hour more interesting.

Most lunch tables have a sign above them that specify a language or technology.  You just sit at a table and random other people that have the same interest end up sitting with you.

I got to talk with a Sr. Engineer from the Federal Reserve bank St. Louis, a core Tableou developer, and many others.

At one lunch I ended up sitting between the NetFlix's chief build Engineer and one of the core Buck build tool developers.  Buck is Facebook's custom build tool.
